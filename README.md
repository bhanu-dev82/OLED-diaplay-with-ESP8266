# OLED-display-with-ESP8266
Using an OLED with a 1.3-inch display can often cause trouble due to missing drivers and many incompatible libraries. To help with this issue, I have created a repository that contains all the resources you need.

This project demonstrates how to display text and numbers on an OLED display using the SH1106Wire library with an ESP8266 board.

#Requirements

    ESP8266 board
    OLED display (1.3 inch)
    Arduino IDE or similar development environment

#Installation

    Connect the OLED display to the ESP8266 board using the SDA and SCL pins.
    Upload the code provided in this repository to the ESP8266 board.

#Usage

The code will display the text "Difference is: 82" on the OLED display.
Troubleshooting

    If the display does not appear, check that the wiring is correct and that the required libraries are installed.
    If the text is not legible, adjust the font size or alignment in the code.
